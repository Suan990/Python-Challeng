# pandas-Challeng
In this module, I was tasked with analyzing data on standardized test results from a city's school district. The task is
to aggregate the data to showcase trends regarding school wise performance for the schools in the city. I used
Pandas, Jupyter notebook and Visual Basic for this assignement. I was given two raw data: schools_complete and 
students_complete. schools_complete has the data on high schools, their size and budget. students_complete has 
data on each student, their gender, grade, school name and math and reading score. 1st I imported this data as 
pandas. I combined these both data into one data set. I then did calculations to get the highest performing schools, 
bottom performing schools, math scores by grade, reading scores by grade, scores by school spending, scores by school type and 
school size. 

Attached are my main results
